Algorithm
---------
Step 0: declare the constants 
Step 1:  cost of fruits into variables
Step 2:  quantity of fruits into variables.
         compute the end quantity, by substituting dozen value.
Step 3:  compute the selling price to each item,
         and add them
Step 4:  compute the discount amount and subtract
         from the selling price, to create payable amount
Step 5:  calculate GST amount and Add to payable amount,
         to create final amount
